# Unweighted Pair Group Method ith Arithmetic Means (UPGMA)

## Input

There is two possible input, either the sequences of DNA, or directly the distance matrix

## Output

For each iteration until completely solved, the algorithm will print the current matrix along with the new smallest relation and the distance that it has.

Example of [calculation](https://www.icp.ucl.ac.be/~opperd/private/upgma.html).
